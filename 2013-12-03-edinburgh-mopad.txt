Check your installation!

To quickly check you have the required tool-set, open up your shell (bash or Git Bash) and run the following commands and you should see the outputs given (don't worry if version numbers differ too much - so long as you have Python 2.6 or 2.7):

$ git --version
You should see a version number printed.

Git basics

$ git --version
$ git help
$ mkdir html
$ cd html
$ git init
$ ls .git
Tell Git who you are so it can log who changed what file, when and why:
$ git config --global user.name "Fred Bloggs"
$ git config --global user.email "fred@bloggs.com"
Specify preferred editor e.g. nano
$ git config --global core.editor "nano"
...or Notepad...
$ git config --global core.editor "notepad"

Git configuration file:
$ cat ~/.gitconfig

Current status of repository:
$ git status
Untracked files - files in the repository that Git has found but Git is not managing
Add file to staging area. Git is aware of the file and that you might want to commit it. Think of this as a loading dock:
$ git add template.html
Commit changes to repository. -m specifies a commit message which says "why" you made these changes. Git can automatically detect what you changed, what lines were changed and when, but only you can say why!
$ git commit -m "First draft" template.html
Git is now managing the versions of template.html
$ git diff template.html
Show difference between current version, that you might have edited, and most recent version in repository.

Show branches:
$ git branch
Create branch:
$ git branch css_test
Checkout branch:
$ git checkout css_test

Using bash command wget to download a file

Setup for scientific programming in Python

Try this:
$ ipython --pylab
In [10]: a = zeros(1000)
In [11]: a[:100] = 1
In [12]: from scipy import *
In [13]: b = fft(a)
In [14]: plot(abs(b))
You should get a graph window appearing.

Simple Python file save example

# Open file test.txt for writing
f = open('test.txt','w')
# Write a line
f.write("This is a test\n")
# Close file
f.close()

Renaming the Lotka-Volterra function

Variables to rename

Within dX_dt it would be valid to keep the variable names a, c, d, b, X, t with a docstring comment for the function explaining that the function implements the Lotka-Volterra equations. For example, here we rename dX_dt to calculate_lotka_volterra and X to population but keep the rest of the variables as they are:

def calculate_lotka_volterra(population, time_step, a, b, c, d):
    ' ' '
    Calculate the Lotka-Volterra equation which models interactions between predators
    and prey.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    population : array-like
        Current population of predators and prey as an array of form [u,v] where u is 
        current prey population and v is current predator population. 
    time : float
        Time-step value.
    a : float
        Prey birth rate.
    b : float
        Prey death rate.
    c : float
        Predator death rate.
    d : float     
        Predator birth rate.

    Return
    ------        
    
    output : array
        Array of form [du/new prey population, new predator population].
    
    The Lotka-Volterra equation is:
    
    du/dt =  a*u -   b*u*v
    dv/dt = -c*v + d*b*u*v
            
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equation

    ' ' '
    u = population[0]
    v = population[1]
    return np.array([ a*u - b*u*v, -c*v + d*b*u*v])

In our program we'd still use prey_config[BIRTH] etc.

populations = integrate.odeint(
    calculate_lotka_volterra,
    initial_population,
    time_series,
    args = (prey_config[BIRTH], prey_config[DEATH], predator_config[DEATH], 
        prey_config[BIRTH]))
    
Save and load comma-separated values in numpy

data = np.zeros((200,300))
np.savetxt('data.csv', data, delimiter=",")

loaded_data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', delimiter=",")
plot(loaded_data)

Adding a header to a numpy data file

import os
import time

data = np.zeros((200,300))

header = "Predator-prey LotkaVolterra simulation\n"
header += "Produced by: " + os.path.basename(__file__) + "\n"
header += "On: " +  time.asctime(time.localtime(time.time())) + "\n"
header += "Time-step,Prey Population,Predator Population\n"
np.savetxt('data.csv', data, delimiter=",", header = header)

numpy.savetxt only supports the header="some header" argument for versions of numpy >= 1.7.0. To check your numpy version do:

python
import numpy
print numpy.__version__

Command-line arguments

import sys

sys.argv is a list which holds the Python script name and command-line arguments. We can access these as, for example:

python_script_name = sys.argv[0]
arg1 = sys.argv[1]
arg2 = sys.argv[2]

So if we ran:

python myscript.py count 123

then python_script_name is myscript.py, arg1 is count, arg2 is 123

Comparing data files

To compare two CSV files with floating point data to within a given tolerance we can do:

import numpy as np
expected = np.loadtxt("expected_data.csv", delimiter=",")
actual = np.loadtxt("output_data.csv", delimiter=",")
assert expected.shape == actual.shape
assert np.allclose(actual, expected, 0.001)

Feedback

+ First-time introduction to version control
- Too much information in too little time
+ Python 
- Common theme, work with same data set rather than switching from patients
+ Git and revision control
- Git not relevant to what I'm doing as it's just me working on my code
+ Making code more reusable across different data sets
- Difficult to catch up if fall behind
+ One projector monitor per table
- Git is complex, would like to see more visual references used
+ PostIts and timing of intervals
- Still unclear on how to use unit testing to help me 
+ Deeper knowledge of Git and Python
- No debugging in Python
+ Version control and also Python 
- Tests only seemed applicable to simple programs and codes
+ Mix of different material covered to get an overview
- Too fast and challenge to keep up
+ Git
- Use an IDE so people can keep up
- Why use Python and not bash for the examples presented?
+ So many helpers
- Thought I'd get more version control and testing - Python was too basic
- Too much in too little time - another day 
+ Introduction to Python 
- Hard to catch up
+ Version control, BitBucket, helpful instructors, PostIts
- Too much in too little time - 3 days might be better?
+ Time spent on the practical aspects
