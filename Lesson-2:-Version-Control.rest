What is Version Control
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Very briefly, version control is a way to keep a backup of changing files, to
store a history of those changes, and most importantly to allow many people in
a collaboration to make changes to the same files concurrently. There are a lot
of verson control systems. Wikipedia provides both a nice vocabulary list and a
fairly complete table of some popular version control systems and their
equivalent commands.

Today, we'll be using SVN. Perhaps someday we'll have a second section of this
experiment to go over distributed version control systems like mercurial.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Checking Out The Code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The Hacker Within has its own online code repository. You can check out code
from it at any time, from anywhere. You checked out some code this morning from
it at googlecode http://code.google.com/p/scbc-2011 in smartsvn. If you gave me
a google id, you are a fully fledged reading writing member today. Remember,
with great power comes great responsibility.

Today, we'll check out an svn type repository at scbc-2011.googlecode.com/svn/
.

********************************************************************************** 
Exercise : Checking out the code
********************************************************************************** 

Step 1 : Open up an internet browser and log in to google.

Step 2 : Now go to the Checkout the source tab and click on the Password link.
Take Note.

Step 3 : Either do this in SmartSVN or crack open a terminal. In SmartSVN,
click on the radio button that says check out project from repository. The
repository location is https://scbc-2011.googlecode.com/svn/ .

In the terminal, if your google user name is buckybadger, do this:

::

  ~$ svn checkout https://scbc-2011.googlecode.com/svn/ \
  scbc-2011 --username buckybadger

Step 4 : You should see many files download themselves onto your machine. Let's
make sure it worked. Either browse in SmartSVN or change directories to the
source code and list the contents.

::

  ~$ cd scbc-2011 ~/scbc-2011$ ls 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Checking The Status of Your Local Copy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The files you've created on your machine are your local "working" copy. The
changes your make in this local copy aren't backed up online automatically.
Until you commit them, the changes you make are local changes. When you change
anything, your set of files becomes different from the files in the official
repository copy. To find out what's different about them in the terminal, try:

::

  ~/scbc-2011$ svn status 


The null result means that you're up to date with the
current version of the repository online! There are a few other responses you
might get if you or your collaborators have been active. We'll see what they
are as we go along.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Updating
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Updating is like voting. You should update early and often , and particularly
before you make or commit any changes. This will ensure you're working with the
most up-to-date version of the repository. Updating won't overwrite any changes
you've made locally without asking, so don't get nervous. When in doubt,
update.

:: 

  ~/scbc-2011$ svn update 
  At revision 19.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Adding New Files to Version Control
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This is great. You can make some changes, and commit them to version control.
But, what if you want to add something totally new? How do you make changes to
a file that doesn't exist yet?

********************************************************************************** 
Exercise : Adding files to Version Control
********************************************************************************** 

Step 1: Create a wiki page about yourself. Please tell us about yourself. Save
a file to the folder called wiki. Call it something unique, like
buckybadger.wiki. Take your time.

:: 

  ~/scbc-2011$ vi buckybadger.wiki

Step 2: Check the status of your local copy For kicks, let's see what SVN
thinks of this.

::

  ~/scbc-2011$ svn status

SVN should report that it hasn't yet been officially introduced to your file.

::

  ? buckybadger.wiki

Step 3: Add the file to version control Now, introduce your file to svn by
adding it to version control.

::

  ~/scbc-2011$ svn add wiki/buckybadger.wiki
  A wiki/buckybadger.wiki

If you want to, commit that change. Your wiki page will be available for anyone
to see on the repo. When your done, give it a look online at
scbc-2011.googlecode.com/wiki.

::

  ~/scbc-2011$ svn commit -m "In commit messages, we usually explain what we've \
  done. Here, we've added a wiki page." 
  Adding wiki/buckybadger.wiki 
  Transmitting file data . 
  Committed revision 86.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Removing Files from Version Control
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

But, let's say you're shy and change your mind about adding this to version
control. Not all pretty faces belong on the internet, after all. If you change
your mind, and would rather not add this wiki page, try svn remove. You can
also just say rm. Be careful, this will delete your local copy of the file.

::

  ~/scbc-2011/wiki$ svn remove buckybadger.wiki 
  D buckybadger.wiki 
  ~/scbc-2011/wiki$ svn commit -m "a log message" 

Deleting hacker-poke/data/myPic.png Committed revision 87.

Making and Committing a Change

Now, recall the software-carpentry.org tutorial. You're Wolfman. The guy next
to you, he's Dracula. I'll be the Mummy. Please pick a random place in one of
the files and insert a comment, like an easter egg.

********************************************************************************** 
Exercise : Making Changes
********************************************************************************** 

Step 1 : Insert something

If you're not in the terminal, just open up the ReadMe.wiki file.

If you're new to the command line, you can open the best text editor like so:

::

  ~/scbc-2011$ cd wiki 
  ~/scbc-2011/wiki$ vi ReadMe.wiki

Once it's open, you'll see some text. Just type the letter 'i' and place a line
anywhere you like. The line is a comment if it begins with a pound sign #, like
so:

::

  #summary A Readme for the Repository
  =Read Me=

  #KATY'S COMMENT
  ==Software Dependencies== 
  * Python 2.71 (or greater?) 
  * Nose 
  * Idle 
  * sqlite (3?) 
  * Smart SVN ? 
  * add more here...  


To save it, press 'ESC', then ':wq' .

Step 2 : Check the status of your local copy

Now that you've changed a file, let's see what SVN thinks about your local
status.

::

  ~/scbc-2011$ svn status 

  M ReadMe.wiki

 

If you want, try committing your change. If it's a comment, it won't break
anything. If you think someone else has committed recently, don't forget to
update first.

:: 
  
  ~/scbc-2011$ svn update

 

If SVN lets you know that someone else has committed changes to the same file
recently, hang on and watch until the next section on conflicts. If svn doesn't
complain, commit.

Step 3 : Commit

::

  ~/scbc-2011$ svn commit -m "The m flag indicates that you'd like to leave a log \
  message saying what you've done. Here, we each added a comment."

The m flag allows you to add a comment that will be stored in the repository to
help your collaborators keep track of the changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Resolving Conflicts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Some of you may have received an error message about a conflict.

********************************************************************************** 
Exercise: Resolving Conflicts
********************************************************************************** 

Step 1 : Update Before Committing

:: 

  $ svn update 

  U ReadMe.wiki

  Conflict discovered in 'ReadMe.wiki'. 

  Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit, (h) help for more options:

Step 2 : Postpone 


The options are many :
 
::

  (p) postpone - mark the conflict to be resolved later (df) diff-full - show
  all changes made to merged file (e) edit - change merged file in an editor (r)
  resolved - accept merged version of file (mf) mine-full - accept my version of
  entire file (ignore their changes) (tf) theirs-full - accept their version of
  entire file (lose my changes) (l) launch - launch external tool to resolve
  conflict (h) help - show this list For now, you want to do some analysis, so
  press p to postpone.

  $ p

Step 3 : Check the Differences

Try diff (or meld if you have it).

::

  $ diff myfile1.py myfile2.py Step 4 : Resolve the Conflict

The svn command resolve in combination with --accept and one of the choices
from before will automatically delete the right files. Alternatively, you could
delete all of the files that you don't like, move the correct one to the right
filename, and try committing again. For now, we'll do it the clean way. For
example, pretend you'd like to accept yours rather than the other.

::

  $ svn resolve --accept ReadMe.wiki.mine Resolved conflicted state of
  'ReadMe.wiki'

Importantly, if you decide to neglect all of your changes instead, you can
choose to revert. Try svn help revert to find out how to do that.

::

  $ svn revert ReadMe.wiki

 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
A test
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Okay Wolfmen, open up KatyHuff.wiki and replace my name with your own (or
someone else's, in case you're shy).

Now, clearly we've all just tried to change the same thing at once. The first
one of us to update and commit will have no problems. However, when the rest of
us try, SVN won't let us merge our changes. We have to talk this one over and
decide who gets to commit. The rest of us will have to resolve conflicts as we
learned. Try it!
