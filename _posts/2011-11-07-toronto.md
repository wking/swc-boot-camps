Software Carpentry is teaming up with [Scinet](http://www.scinethpc.ca/about-
scinet/) and [The Hacker Within](http://hackerwithin.org/thw/) to host a 2 day
workshop on software engineering at the University of Toronto for graduate
students in the sciences. The workshop is sold out, but we'll be posting all
of our course materials here for anyone who wants to use them.

**Information for Attendees**

Please follow the instructions on the setup page _before_ November 7 so we can
get a quick start.

The SWC Bootcamp will be covering several topics including data storage, the
shell, and a lot of Python. Everything is interactive, which means you should
bring a laptop and your power cord with you both days.
