The *shell* is a program that presents a command line interface which
allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a
keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with
a mouse/keyboard combination.

There are many reasons to learn about the shell. In my opinion, the
most important reasons are that:

1.  It is very common to encounter the shell and
    command-line-interfaces in scientific computing, so you will
    probably have to learn it eventually

2.  The shell is a really powerful way of interacting with your
    computer. GUIs and the shell are complementary—by knowing both you
    will greatly expand the range of tasks you can accomplish with
    your computer. You will also be able to perform many tasks more
    efficiently.
